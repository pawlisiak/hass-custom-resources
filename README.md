# Home Assistant custom resources

Custom cards, components and scripts made for my Home Assistant dashboard.

## Getting started

Clone the repository and in main folder run:

```
yarn install
```

Then build the project:

```
yarn build
```

Build resources are in `/dist/` folder. Copy them to `/config/www/` folder of your HASS installation and add as custom resources.
